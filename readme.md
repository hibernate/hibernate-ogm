# Hibernate OGM

Version: 4.0.0-SNAPSHOT

## Description

Hibernate OGM is an attempt to store data in a NoSQL data grid using the Hibernate ORM engine rather than rewriting a JPA engine from scratch.

The benefits are fairly obvious:
 - reimplementing the complex JPA specification is a lot of work
 - a new implementation would mature at a rather slow rate and risk of bugs would be high
 - Hibernate is familiar to many people

## Instructions

Checkout <http://ogm.hibernate.org for more information>
The code is available on GitHub at <https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-ogm>

To build the project, run

    mvn clean install -s settings-example.xml

### Documentation

To build the documentation, set the `buildDocs` property to `true`.

    mvn clean install -DbuildDocs=true -s settings-example.xml

If you just want to build the documentation, run it from the `hibernate-ogm-documentation/manual` subdirectory.

### MongoDB

If you have MongoDB installed on `localhost` and the default port, use the mongodb profile as well

    mvn clean install -s settings-example.xml -Pmongodb

If you have MongoDB installed in a non default host / port, you can set the environment variables
and then run the test suite

    export MONGODB_HOSTNAME=mongodb-machine
    export MONGODB_PORT=1234
    mvn clean install -s settings-example.xml -Pmongodb
