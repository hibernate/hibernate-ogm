This file is not fleshed out, it's just a collection of tips.

### Linefeed

A soft limit of 100 characters is recommended.
At the end of each sentence, go to the next line.
Consider going to the next line for each new clause, in particular if the sentence would go beyond 100 characters.
But do not obsess: if a multi-clause sentence is below 100 characters,
don't split it to limit the _verticality_ of the document.
For long links, tend to go to the next line.

The 100 characters limit is used because GitHub diffs are around 116 chars long.

## Diagrams

Diagrams are done in OmniGraffle and stored as XML files in `src/main/omnigraffle`.
Export the omnigraffle files as `png` with a dot per inch of 72.
This will create a file of the right size for the web.

`png` files should be placed under `src/main/resources/images`.
