== 5.4.2.Final

=== MongoDB

==== MongoDB Java Driver

This patch release updates the underlying MongoDB Java driver from 3.11 to 4.11.  It also fixes some incompatibilities
with more recent versions of MongoDB that prevent 5.4.1.Final from executing native queries.

As a consequence of the driver update, the oldest MongoDB server release that hibernate-ogm will connect to is now 3.6 (which reached
end of life in April 2021).

=== MongoDB Server

Recent versions of the MongoDB server have removed support for some features on which hibernate-ogm depend. In particular:

* MongoDB 4.2 removed support for the `$eval` command, on which hibernate-ogm support for stored procedures depends.

All other hibernate-ogm tests of MongoDB support are passing with MongoDB 3.6, up through the latest release of MongoDB
(currently MongoDB 8.0).
