== Infinispan

Infinispan is an open source in-memory data grid focusing on high performance.
As a data grid, you can deploy it on multiple servers - referred to as nodes -
and connect to it as if it were a single storage engine:
it will cleverly distribute both the computation effort and the data storage.

It is trivial to setup on a single node, in your local JVM,
so you can easily try Hibernate OGM.
But Infinispan really shines in multiple node deployments:
you will need to configure some networking details
but nothing changes in terms of application behaviour,
while performance and data size can scale linearly.

From all its features we will only describe those relevant to Hibernate OGM;
for a complete description of all its capabilities and configuration options,
refer to the Infinispan project documentation at
http://infinispan.org[infinispan.org].

[[ogm-infinispan-configuration]]

=== Configure Infinispan

You configure Hibernate OGM and Infinispan in two steps basically:

* Add the dependencies to your classpath
* And then choose one of:

** Use the default Infinispan configuration (no action needed)
** Point to your own configuration resource file
** Point to a [acronym]+JNDI+ name of an existing Infinispan instance


[[ogm-infinispan-adddepencies]]

==== Adding Infinispan dependencies

To add the dependencies via Maven, add the following module:


[source, XML]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.ogm</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-ogm-infinispan</artifactId>
    <version>{hibernate-ogm-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

If you're not using a dependency management tool,
copy all the dependencies from the distribution in the directories:

* +/lib/required+
* +/lib/infinispan+
* Optionally - depending on your container - you might need some of the jars from +/lib/provided+


[[ogm-infinispan-configuration-properties]]

==== Infinispan specific configuration properties

The advanced configuration details of an Infinispan Cache
are defined in an Infinispan specific XML configuration file;
the Hibernate OGM properties are simple
and usually just point to this external resource.

To use the default configuration provided by Hibernate OGM -
which is a good starting point for new users - you don't have to set any property.

.Hibernate OGM properties for Infinispan
+hibernate.ogm.datastore.provider+::
Set it to +infinispan+ to use Infinispan as the datastore provider.
+hibernate.ogm.infinispan.cachemanager_jndi_name+::
If you have an Infinispan [classname]+EmbeddedCacheManager+ registered in JNDI,
provide the JNDI name and Hibernate OGM will use this instance
instead of starting a new +CacheManager+.
This will ignore any further configuration properties
as Infinispan is assumed being already configured.
Infinispan can typically be pushed to JNDI via WildFly, Spring or Seam.
+hibernate.ogm.infinispan.configuration_resource_name+::
Should point to the resource name of an Infinispan configuration file.
This is ignored in case [acronym]+JNDI+  lookup is set.
Defaults to +org/hibernate/ogm/datastore/infinispan/default-config.xml+.
+hibernate.ogm.datastore.keyvalue.cache_storage+::
The strategy for persisting data in Infinispan.
The following two strategies exist (values of the +org.hibernate.ogm.datastore.keyvalue.options.CacheMappingType+ enum):

* +CACHE_PER_TABLE+: A dedicated cache will be used for each entity type, association type and id source table.
* +CACHE_PER_KIND+: Three caches will be used: one cache for all entities, one cache for all associations and one cache for all id sources.

+
Defaults to +CACHE_PER_TABLE+. It is the recommended strategy as it makes it easier to target a specific cache for a given entity.

[NOTE]
====
When bootstrapping a session factory or entity manager factory programmatically,
you should use the constants accessible via +InfinispanProperties+
when specifying the configuration properties listed above.

Common properties shared between stores are declared on +OgmProperties+
(a super interface of +InfinispanProperties+).

For maximum portability between stores, use the most generic interface possible.
====

==== Cache names used by Hibernate OGM

Depending on the cache mapping approach, Hibernate OGM will either:

* store each entity type, association type and id source table in a dedicated cache
  very much like what Hibernate ORM would do. This is the +CACHE_PER_TABLE+ approach.
* store data in three different caches when using the +CACHE_PER_KIND+ approach:
** +ENTITIES+: is going to be used to store the main attributes of all your entities.
** +ASSOCIATIONS+: stores the association information representing the links between entities.
** +IDENTIFIER_STORE+: contains internal metadata that Hibernate OGM needs
    to provide sequences and auto-incremental numbers for primary key generation.

The preferred strategy is +CACHE_PER_TABLE+ as it offers both more fine grained configuration options
and the ability to work on specific entities in a more simple fashion.

In the following paragraphs, we will explain which aspects of Infinispan
you're likely to want to reconfigure from their defaults.
All attributes and elements from Infinispan which we don't mention are safe to ignore.
Refer to the http://infinispan.org/documentation/[Infinispan User Guide]
for the guru level performance tuning and customizations.

An Infinispan configuration file is an XML file complying with the Infinispan schema;
the basic structure is shown in the following example:

        <local-cache name="associations_User_Order"/>

    </cache-container>
</infinispan>
----
====

There are global settings that can be set before the +cache_container+ section.
These settings will affect the whole instance;
mainly of interest for Hibernate OGM users is the +jgroups+ element
in which we will set JGroups configuration overrides.

Inside the +cache-container+ section are defined explicit named caches and their configurations
as well as the default cache (named +DEFAULT+ here) if we want to affect all named caches.
This is where we will likely want to configure clustering modes, eviction policies and ++CacheStore++s.

[[ogm-infinispan-storage]]

=== Manage data size

In its default configuration Infinispan stores all data in the heap of the JVM;
in this barebone mode it is conceptually not very different than using a HashMap:
the size of the data should fit in the heap of your VM,
and stopping/killing/crashing your application will get all data lost
with no way to recover it.

To store data permanently (out of the JVM memory) a +CacheStore+ should be enabled.
The +infinispan-core.jar+ includes a simple implementation
able to store data in simple binary files, on any read/write mounted filesystem;
this is an easy starting point, but the real stuff is to be found
in the additional modules found in the Infinispan distribution.
Here you can find many more implementations to store your data in anything
from JDBC connected relational databases, other NoSQL engines,
to cloud storage services or other Infinispan clusters.
Finally, implementing a custom +CacheStore+ is quite easy.

To limit the memory consumption of the precious heap space,
you can activate a +passivation+ or an +eviction+ policy;
again there are several strategies to play with,
for now let's just consider you'll likely need one to avoid running out of memory
when storing too many entries in the bounded JVM memory space;
of course you don't need to choose one while experimenting with limited data sizes:
enabling such a strategy doesn't have any other impact
in the functionality of your Hibernate OGM application
(other than performance: entries stored in the Infinispan in-memory space
is accessed much quicker than from any CacheStore).

A +CacheStore+ can be configured as write-through,
committing all changes to the +CacheStore+ before returning (and in the same transaction)
or as write-behind.
A write-behind configuration is normally not encouraged in storage engines,
as a failure of the node implies some data might be lost
without receiving any notification about it,
but this problem is mitigated in Infinispan because of its capability
to combine CacheStore write-behind
with a synchronous replication to other Infinispan nodes.

.Enabling a FileCacheStore and eviction
====


[source, XML]
----
<local-cache name="User">
    <transaction mode="NON_DURABLE_XA"
                 transaction-manager-lookup="org.infinispan.transaction.lookup.JBossStandaloneJTAManagerLookup"/>
    <eviction strategy="LIRS" max-entries="2000"/>
    <persistence passivation="true">
        <file-store
           shared="false"
           path="/var/infinispan/myapp/users"
            <write-behind flush-lock-timeout="15000" thread-pool-size="5" />
        </file-store>
    </persistence>
</local-cache>
----

====

In this example we enabled both +eviction+ and a +CacheStore+ (the +persistence+ element).
+LIRS+ is one of the choices we have for eviction strategies.
Here it is configured to keep (approximately) 2000 entries in live memory
and evict the remaining as a memory usage control strategy.

The +CacheStore+ is enabling +passivation+,
which means that the entries which are evicted are stored on the filesystem.

[WARNING]
====
You could configure an eviction strategy while not configuring a passivating CacheStore!
That is a valid configuration for Infinispan but will have the evictor permanently remove entries.
Hibernate OGM will break in such a configuration.
====

[[ogm-infinispan-clustering]]

=== Clustering: store data on multiple Infinispan nodes

The best thing about Infinispan is that all nodes are treated equally
and it requires almost no beforehand capacity planning:
to add more nodes to the cluster you just have to start new JVMs,
on the same or different physical servers,
having your same Infinispan configuration and your same application.

Infinispan supports several clustering _cache modes_;
each mode provides the same API and functionality
but with different performance, scalability and availability options:

.Infinispan cache modes
local::
Useful for a single VM: networking stack is disabled
replication::
All data is replicated to each node;
each node contains a full copy of all entries.
Consequentially reads are faster but writes don't scale as well.
Not suited for very large datasets.
distribution::
Each entry is distributed on multiple nodes for redundancy and failure recovery,
but not to all the nodes.
Provides linear scalability for both write and read operations.
distribution is the default mode.

To use the +replication+ or +distribution+ cache modes
Infinispan will use JGroups to discover and connect to the other nodes.

In the default configuration,
JGroups will attempt to autodetect peer nodes using a multicast socket;
this works out of the box in the most network environments
but will require some extra configuration in cloud environments
(which often block multicast packets) or in case of strict firewalls.
See the http://www.jgroups.org/manual/html_single/[JGroups reference documentation],
specifically look for _Discovery Protocols_ to customize the detection of peer nodes.

Nowadays, the [acronym]+JVM+ defaults to use [acronym]+IPv6+ network stack;
this will work fine with JGroups, but only if you configured [acronym]+IPv6+ correctly.
It is often useful to force the [acronym]+JVM+ to use [acronym]+IPv4+.

It is also useful to let JGroups know which networking interface you want to use;
especially if you have multiple interfaces it might not guess correctly.

.JVM properties to set for clustering
====

----
#192.168.122.1 is an example IPv4 address
-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -Djgroups.bind_addr=192.168.122.1
----
====

[NOTE]
====
You don't need to use [acronym]+IPv4+: JGroups is compatible with [acronym]+IPv6+
provided you have routing properly configured and valid addresses assigned.

The +jgroups.bind_addr+ needs to match a placeholder name
in your JGroups configuration in case you don't use the default one.
====

The default configuration uses +distribution+ as cache mode
and uses the +jgroups-tcp.xml+ configuration for JGroups,
which is contained in the Infinispan jar
as the default configuration for Infinispan users.
Let's see how to reconfigure this:

    </cache-container>

</infinispan>
----
====

In the example above we specify a custom JGroups configuration file
and set the cache mode for the default cache to +distribution+;
this is going to be inherited by the +Order+ and the +associations_User_Order+ caches.
But for +User+ we have chosen (for the sake of this example) to use +replication+.

Now that you have clustering configured, start the service on multiple nodes.
Each node will need the same configuration and jars.

[TIP]
====
We have just shown how to override the clustering mode
and the networking stack for the sake of completeness, but you don't have to!

Start with the default configuration and see if that fits you.
You can fine tune these setting when you are closer to going in production.
====

[[ogm-infinispan-storage-principles]]
=== Storage principles

To describe things simply, each entity is stored under a single key.
The value itself is a map containing the columns / values pair.

Each association from one entity instance to (a set of) another is stored under a single key.
The value contains the navigational information to the (set of) entity.

[[ogm-infinispan-built-in-types]]
==== Properties and built-in types

Each entity is represented by a map.
Each property or more precisely column is represented by an entry in this map,
the key being the column name.

Hibernate OGM support by default the following property types:

* [classname]+java.lang.String+
* [classname]+java.lang.Character+ (or char primitive)
* [classname]+java.lang.Boolean+ (or boolean primitive); Optionally the annotations +@Type(type = "true_false")+, @Type(type = "yes_no") and @Type(type = "numeric_boolean") can be used to map boolean properties to the characters 'T'/'F', 'Y'/'N' or the int values 0/1, respectively.
* [classname]+java.lang.Byte+ (or byte primitive)
* [classname]+java.lang.Short+ (or short primitive)
* [classname]+java.lang.Integer+ (or integer primitive)
* [classname]+java.lang.Long+ (or long primitive)
* [classname]+java.lang.Integer+ (or integer primitive)
* [classname]+java.lang.Float+ (or float primitive)
* [classname]+java.lang.Double+ (or double primitive)

* [classname]+java.math.BigDecimal+
* [classname]+java.math.BigInteger+

* [classname]+java.util.Calendar+
* [classname]+java.util.Date+
* [classname]+java.util.UUID+
* [classname]+java.util.URL+

[NOTE]
====
Hibernate OGM doesn't store null values in Infinispan,
setting a value to null is the same as removing the corresponding entry
from Infinispan.

This can have consequences when it comes to queries on null value.
====

==== Identifiers

Entity identifiers are used to build the key in which the entity is stored in the cache.

The key is comprised of the following information:

* the identifier column names
* the identifier column values
* the entity table (for the +CACHE_PER_KIND+ strategy)

In +CACHE_PER_TABLE+, the table name is inferred from the cache name.
In +CACHE_PER_KIND+, the table name is necessary to identify the entity in the generic cache.

===== Identifier generation strategies

Since Infinispan has not native sequence nor identity column support,
these are simulated using the table strategy, however their default values vary.
We highly recommend you explicitly use a +TABLE+ strategy if you want to generate a monotonic identifier.

But if you can, use a pure in-memory and scalable strategy like a UUID generator.

==== Entities

Entities are stored in the cache named after the entity name when using the +CACHE_PER_TABLE+ strategy.
In the +CACHE_PER_KIND+ strategy, entities are stored in a single cache named +ENTITIES+.

The key is comprised of the following information:

* the identifier column names
* the identifier column values
* the entity table (for the +CACHE_PER_KIND+ strategy)

In +CACHE_PER_TABLE+, the table name is inferred from the cache name.
In +CACHE_PER_KIND+, the table name is necessary to identify the entity in the generic cache.

The entry value is an instance of [classname]+org.infinispan.atomic.FineGrainedMap+ 
which contains all the entity properties -
or to be specific columns.
Each column name and value is stored as a key / value pair in the map.
We use this specialized map as Infinispan is able to transport changes
in a much more efficient way.

Here, we see that the collection of elements is stored in a separate cache and entry.
The association key is made of:

* the foreign key column names pointing to the owner of this association
* the foreign key column values pointing to the owner of this association
* the association table name in the +CACHE_PER_KIND+ approach where all associations share the same cache

The association entry is a map containing the representation of each entry in the collection.
The keys of that map are made of:

* the names of the columns uniquely identifying that specific collection entry
  (e.g. for a +Set+ this is all of the columns)
* the values of the columns uniquely identifying that specific collection entry

The value attack to that collection entry key is a Map containing the key value pairs column name / column value.

Here we used an indexed collection and to identify the entry in the collection,
only the owning entity id and the index value is enough.

==== Associations

Associations between entities are mapped like (collection of) embeddables 
except that the target entity is represented by its identifier(s).

[[ogm-infinispan-transactions]]

=== Transactions

Infinispan supports transactions and integrates with any standard JTA +TransactionManager+;
this is a great advantage for JPA users as it allows to experience a _similar_ behaviour
to the one we are used to when we work with RDBMS databases.

If you're having Hibernate OGM start and manage Infinispan,
you can skip this as it will inject the same [classname]+TransactionManager+ instance
which you already have set up in the Hibernate / JPA configuration.

If you are providing an already started Infinispan CacheManager instance
by using the [acronym]+JNDI+ lookup approach,
then you have to make sure the CacheManager is using the same [classname]+TransactionManager+
as Hibernate:

.Configuring a JBoss Standalone TransactionManager lookup in Infinispan configuration
====
[source, XML]
----
<default>
   <transaction
      transactionMode="TRANSACTIONAL"
      transactionManagerLookupClass=
    "org.infinispan.transaction.lookup.JBossStandaloneJTAManagerLookup" />
</default>
----
====

Infinispan supports different transaction modes like +PESSIMISTIC+ and +OPTIMISTIC+,
supports [acronym]+XA+ recovery and provides many more configuration options;
see the http://infinispan.org/documentation/[Infinispan User Guide]
for more advanced configuration options.

[[ogm-infinispan-indexstorage]]

=== Storing a Lucene index in Infinispan

Hibernate Search, which can be used for advanced query capabilities (see <<ogm-query>>),
needs some place to store the indexes for its embedded +Apache Lucene+ engine.

A common place to store these indexes is the filesystem
which is the default for Hibernate Search;
however if your goal is to scale your NoSQL engine on multiple nodes
you need to share this index.
Network sharing file systems are a possibility but we don't recommended that.
Often the best option is to store the index
in whatever NoSQL database you are using (or a different dedicated one).

[TIP]
====
You might find this section useful even if you don't intend to store your data in Infinispan.
====

The Infinispan project provides an adaptor to plug into Apache Lucene,
so that it writes the indexes in Infinispan and searches data in it.
Since Infinispan can be used as an application cache to other NoSQL storage engines
by using a CacheStore (see <<ogm-infinispan-storage>>)
you can use this adaptor to store the Lucene indexes
in any NoSQL store supported by Infinispan:

* Cassandra
* Filesystem (but locked correctly at the Infinispan level)
* MongoDB
* HBase
* JDBC databases
* JDBM
* BDBJE
* A secondary (independent) Infinispan grid
* Any Cloud storage service
  http://www.jclouds.org/documentation/reference/supported-providers/[supported by JClouds]


How to configure it? Here is a simple cheat sheet to get you started with this type of setup:

* Add +org.hibernate:hibernate-search-infinispan:{hibernate-search-version}+ to your dependencies
* set these configuration properties:

** +hibernate.search.default.directory_provider = infinispan+
** +hibernate.search.default.exclusive_index_use = false+
** +hibernate.search.infinispan.configuration_resourcename =+ [infinispan configuration filename]


The referenced Infinispan configuration should define a [classname]+CacheStore+
to load/store the index in the NoSQL engine of choice.
It should also define three cache names:

.Infinispan caches used to store indexes
[cols="1,2,1", options="header"]
|===============
|Cache name|Description|Suggested cluster mode
|LuceneIndexesLocking|Transfers locking information. Does not need a cache
            store.|replication
|LuceneIndexesData|Contains the bulk of Lucene data. Needs a cache
            store.|distribution + L1
|LuceneIndexesMetadata|Stores metadata on the index segments. Needs a cache
            store.|replication
|===============

This configuration is not going to scale well on write operations:
to do that you should read about the master/slave and sharding options in Hibernate Search.
The complete explanation and configuration options can be found in the
http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/4.2/reference/en-US/html_single/#infinispan-directories[Hibernate Search Reference Guide]

Some NoSQL support storage of Lucene indexes directly,
in which case you might skip the Infinispan Lucene integration
by implementing a custom [classname]+DirectoryProvider+ for Hibernate Search.
You're very welcome to share the code
and have it merged in Hibernate Search for others to use, inspect, improve and maintain.
