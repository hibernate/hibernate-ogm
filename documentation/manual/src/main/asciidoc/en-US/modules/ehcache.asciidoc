=== Ehcache

When combined with Hibernate ORM, Ehcache is commonly used as a 2nd level cache,
so caching data which is stored in a relational database.
When used with Hibernate OGM it is not "just a cache"
but is the main storage engine for your data.

This is not the reference manual for Ehcache itself:
we're going to list only how Hibernate OGM should be configured to use Ehcache;
for all the tuning and advanced options please refer to the
http://www.ehcache.org/documentation[Ehcache Documentation].

[[ogm-ehcache-configuration]]

==== Configure Ehcache

Two steps:

* Add the dependencies to classpath
* And then choose one of:

** Use the default Ehcache configuration (no action needed)
** Point to your own configuration resource name


[[ogm-ehcache-adddepencies]]

===== Adding Ehcache dependencies

To add the dependencies via some Maven-definitions-using tool,
add the following module:

[source, XML]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.ogm</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-ogm-ehcache</artifactId>
    <version>{hibernate-ogm-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

If you're not using a dependency management tool,
copy all the dependencies from the distribution in the directories:

* +/lib/required+
* +/lib/ehcache+
* Optionally - depending on your container -
  you might need some of the jars from +/lib/provided+


[[ogm-ehcache-configuration-properties]]

===== Ehcache specific configuration properties

Hibernate OGM expects you to define an Ehcache configuration
in its own configuration resource;
all what we need to set it the resource name.

To use the default configuration provided by Hibernate OGM -
which is a good starting point for new users - you don't have to set any property.

.Ehcache datastore configuration properties
hibernate.ogm.datastore.provider::
To use Ehcache as a datastore provider set it to +ehcache+.
hibernate.ogm.ehcache.configuration_resourcename::
Should point to the resource name of an Ehcache configuration file.
Defaults to +/org/hibernate/ogm/datastore/ehcache/default-ehcache.xml+.

[[ogm-ehcache-transactions]]

==== Transactions

While Ehcache technically supports transactions,
Hibernate OGM is currently unable to use them. Careful!

If you need this feature, it should be easy to implement:
