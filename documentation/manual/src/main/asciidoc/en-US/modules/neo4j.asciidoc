[[ogm-neo4j]]

== Neo4j

http://www.neo4j.org[Neo4j] is a robust (fully ACID) transactional property graph database.
This kind of databases are suited for those type of problems that can be represented with a graph 
like social relationships or road maps for example.

At the moment only the support for the embedded Neo4j is included in OGM.

=== How to add Neo4j integration

.1. Add the dependencies to your project
If your project uses Maven you can add this to the pom.xml: 

[source, XML]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.ogm</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-ogm-neo4j</artifactId>
    <version>{hibernate-ogm-version}</version>
</dependency>
----
Alternatively you can find the required libraries in the distribution package on https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/hibernate/hibernate-ogm/{hibernate-ogm-version}/hibernate-ogm-{hibernate-ogm-version}-dist.zip[SourceForge]

.2. Add the following properties:

[source, properties]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
hibernate.ogm.datastore.provider = neo4j_embedded
hibernate.ogm.neo4j.database_path = C:\example\mydb
----

=== Configuring Neo4j

The following properties are available to configure Neo4j support:

.Neo4j datastore configuration properties
hibernate.ogm.neo4j.database_path::
The absolute path representing the location of the Neo4j database. Example: +C:\neo4jdb\mydb+
hibernate.ogm.neo4j.configuration_resource_name (optional)::
Location of the Neo4j embedded properties file. It can be an URL, name of a classpath resource or file system path.
hibernate.schema_update.unique_constraint_strategy (optional)::
If set to +SKIP+, Hibernate OGM won't create any unique constraints on the nodes representing the entities.
This property won't affect the unique constraints generated for sequences.
Other possible values (defined on the +org.hibernate.tool.hbm2ddl.UniqueConstraintSchemaUpdateStrategy+ enum) are +DROP_RECREATE_QUIETLY+ and +RECREATE_QUIETLY+
but the effect will be the same (since Neo4j constraints don't have a name):
keep the existing constraints and create the missing one.
Default value is +DROP_RECREATE_QUIETLY+.

[WARNING]
====
At the moment, you must not specify the property +hibernate.transaction.jta.platform+ when using Neo4j.
It would override Hibernate OGM's version and the transactions would not work correctly.
====

[NOTE]
====
Use the following method to retrieve the transaction manager
(it needs to be done after the +EntityManagerFactory+ has been bootstrapped):

[source, JAVA]
----
private static TransactionManager extractJBossTransactionManager(EntityManagerFactory factory) {
    SessionFactoryImplementor sessionFactory =
        (SessionFactoryImplementor) ( (HibernateEntityManagerFactory) factory ).getSessionFactory();
    return sessionFactory.getServiceRegistry().getService( JtaPlatform.class ).retrieveTransactionManager();
}
----
====

[NOTE]
====
When bootstrapping a session factory or entity manager factory programmatically,
you should use the constants accessible via +Neo4jProperties+
when specifying the configuration properties listed above.

Common properties shared between stores are declared on +OgmProperties+
(a super interface of +Neo4jProperties+).

For maximum portability between stores, use the most generic interface possible.
====

[[ogm-neo4j-storage-principles]]
=== Storage principles

Hibernate OGM tries to make the mapping to the underlying datastore as natural as possible
so that third party applications not using Hibernate OGM can still read
and update the same datastore.

To make things simple, each entity is represented by a node,
each embedded object is also represented by a node.
Links between entities (whether to-one to to-many associations)
are represented by relationships between nodes.
Entity and embedded nodes are labelled +ENTITY+ and +EMBEDDED+ respectively.

[[ogm-neo4j-built-in-types]]
==== Properties and built-in types

Each entity is represented by a node.
Each property or more precisely column is represented by an attribute of this node.

The following types (and corresponding primitives) get passed to Neo4j without any conversion:

* [classname]+java.lang.Boolean+
* [classname]+java.lang.Character+
* [classname]+java.lang.Byte+
* [classname]+java.lang.Short+
* [classname]+java.lang.Integer+
* [classname]+java.lang.Long+
* [classname]+java.lang.Float+
* [classname]+java.lang.Double+
* [classname]+java.lang.String+

The following types get converted into [classname]+java.lang.String+:

* [classname]+java.math.BigDecimal+
* [classname]+java.math.BigInteger+
* [classname]+java.util.Calendar+

  stored as +String+ with the format "yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss:SSS Z"

* [classname]+java.util.Date+

  stored as +String+ with the format "yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss:SSS Z"

* [classname]+java.util.UUID+
* [classname]+java.util.URL+

[NOTE]
====
Hibernate OGM doesn't store null values in Neo4J,
setting a value to null is the same as removing the corresponding entry
from Neo4J.

This can have consequences when it comes to queries on null value.
====

==== Entities

Entities are stored as Neo4j nodes,
which means each entity property will be translated into a property of the node.
The name of the table mapping the entity is used as label.

You can use the name property of the [classname]+@Table+ and [classname]+@Column+ annotations
to rename the label and the node's properties.

An additional label +ENTITY+ is added to the node.

.Default JPA mapping for an entity
====
[source, JAVA]
----
@Entity
public class News {

    @Id
    private String id;
    private String title;

    // getters, setters ...
}
----

[source, JAVA]
----
@Entity
@Table(name="ARTICLE")
public class News {

    @Id
    private String id;

    @Column(name = "headline")
    private String title;

    // getters, setters ...
}
----

====

===== Identifiers and unique constraints

[WARNING]
====
Neo4j does not support constraints on more than one property.
For this reason, Hibernate OGM will create a unique constraint ONLY when it spans
a single property and it will ignore the ones spanning multiple properties.

The lack of unique constraints on node properties might result in the creation of multiple
nodes with the same identifier.
====

Hibernate OGM will create unique constraints for the identifier of entities and for the properties 
annotated with:

* +@Id+
* +@EmbeddedId+
* +@NaturalId+
* +@Column( unique = true )+
* +@Table( uniqueConstraints = @UniqueConstraint(columnNames = { "column_name" } ) )+

Embedded identifiers are currently stored as dot separated properties.

.Entity with @EmbeddedId
====
[source, JAVA]
----
@Entity
public class News {

    @EmbeddedId
    private NewsID newsId;

    private String content

    // getters, setters ...
}

@Embeddable
public class NewsID implements Serializable {

    private String title;
    private String author;

    // getters, setters ...
}
----

image::images/neo4j-@EmbeddedId-example.png[align="center", depth="", scalefit="1"]
====

===== Embedded objects and collections

Embedded elements are stored as separate nodes labeled with +EMBEDDED+.

The the type of the relationship that connects the entity node to the embedded node is
the attribute name representing the embedded in the java class.

.Embedded object
====
[source, JAVA]
----
@Entity
public class News {

    @EmbeddedId
    private NewsID newsId;

    @Embedded
    private NewsPaper paper;

    // getters, setters ...
}

@Embeddable
public class NewsID implements Serializable {

    private String title;
    private String author;

    // getters, setters ...
}

@Embeddable
public class NewsPaper {

    private String name;
    private String owner;

    // getters, setters ...
}
----

.@ElementCollection
====
[source, JAVA]
----
@Entity
public class GrandMother {

    @Id
    private String id;

    @ElementCollection
    private List<GrandChild> grandChildren = new ArrayList<GrandChild>();

    // getters, setters ...
}

@Embeddable
public class GrandChild {

    private String name;

    // getters, setters ...
}
----

image::images/neo4j-@ElementCollection-example.png[align="center", depth="", scalefit="1"]
====

Note that in the previous examples no property is added to the relationships;
in the following one, one property is added to keep track of the order of the elements in the list.

.@ElementCollection with @OrderColumn
====
[source, JAVA]
----
@Entity
public class GrandMother {

    @Id
    private String id;

    @ElementCollection
    @OrderColumn( name = "birth_order" )
    private List<GrandChild> grandChildren = new ArrayList<GrandChild>();

    // getters, setters ...
}

@Embeddable
public class GrandChild {

    private String name;

    // getters, setters ...
}
----

image::images/neo4j-@ElementCollection-@OrderColumn-example.png[align="center", depth="", scalefit="1"]
====

==== Associations

An association, bidirectional or unidirectional, is always mapped using one relationship,
beginning at the owning side of the association.
This is possible because in Neo4j relationships can be navigated in both directions.

The type of the relationships depends on the type of the association,
but in general it is the role of the association on the main side.
The only property stored on the relationship is going to be the index of the association when required,
for example when the association is annotated with +@OrderColumn+ or when a +java.util.Map+ is used.

In Neo4j nodes are connected via relationship, this means that we don't need to create properties
which store foreign column keys. This means that annotation like +@JoinColumn+ won't have any effect.

.Unidirectional one-to-one
====

public class Vehicule {

    @Id

==== Auto-generated Values

Hibernate OGM supports the table generation strategy as well as the sequence generation strategy with Neo4j.
It is generally recommended to work with the latter,
as it allows a slightly more efficient querying for the next sequence value.

Sequence-based generators are represented by nodes in the following form:

.GenerationType.SEQUENCE
====
[source, JAVA]
----
@Entity
public class Song {

    ...

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue( strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator = "songSequenceGenerator" )
    @SequenceGenerator(
            name = "songSequenceGenerator",
            sequenceName = "song_sequence",
            initialValue = INITIAL_VALUE,
            allocationSize = 10)
    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }

    ...
----

image::images/neo4j-sequence-example.png[align="center", depth="", scalefit="1"]
====

Each sequence generator node is labelled with +SEQUENCE+.
The sequence name can be specified via +@SequenceGenerator#sequenceName()+.
A unique constraint is applied to the property +sequence_name+ in order to ensure uniqueness of sequences.

If required, you can set the initial value of a sequence and the increment size via
+@SequenceGenerator#initialValue()+ and +@SequenceGenerator#allocationSize()+, respectively.
The options +@SequenceGenerator#catalog()+ and +@SequenceGenerator#schema()+ are not supported.

Table-based generators are represented by nodes in the following form:

.GenerationType.TABLE
====
[source, JAVA]
----
@Entity
public class Video {

    ...

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue( strategy = GenerationType.TABLE, generator = "video" )
    @TableGenerator(
         name = "video",
         table = "Sequences",
         pkColumnName = "key",
         pkColumnValue = "video",
         valueColumnName = "seed"
    )
    public Integer getId() {
        return id;
    }

    ...
----

image::images/neo4j-table-based-sequence-example.png[align="center", depth="", scalefit="1"]
====

Each table generator node is labelled with +TABLE_BASED_SEQUENCE+
and the table name as specified via +@TableGenerator#table()+.
The sequence name is to be given via +@TableGenerator#pkColumnValue()+.
The node properties holding the sequence name and value can be configured via
+@TableGenerator#pkColumnName()+ and +@TableGenerator#valueColumnName()+, respectively.
A unique constraint is applied to the property +sequence_name+ to avoid the same sequence name is used twice within the same "table".

If required, you can set the initial value of a sequence and the increment size via
+@TableGenerator#initialValue()+ and +@TableGenerator#allocationSize()+, respectively.
The options +@TableGenerator#catalog()+, +@TableGenerator#schema()+, +@TableGenerator#uniqueConstraints()+ and +@TableGenerator#indexes()+  are not supported.

==== Labels summary

The maximum number of labels the database can contain is roughly 2 billion.

The following summary will help you to keep track of the labels assigned to a new node:

.Summary of the labels assigned to a new node
[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
     ^| NODE TYPE                   ^| LABELS

      | Entity                       | ENTITY, <Entity class name>
      | Embeddable                   | EMBEDDED, <Embeddable class name>
      | GenerationType.SEQUENCE      | SEQUENCE
      | GenerationType.TABLE         | TABLE_BASED_SEQUENCE, <Table name>

[[ogm-neo4j-transactions]]
=== Transactions

[CAUTION]
====
Neo4J operations must be executed inside a transaction.
Make sure your interactions with Hibernate OGM are within a transaction when you target Neo4J.
====

Unless a different `org.hibernate.engine.transaction.jta.platform.spi.JtaPlatform` is specified, Hibernate OGM will use a specific implementation to integrate with the Neo4j transaction mechanism.
This means that you can start and commit transaction using the Hibernate session.

The drawback is that it is not possible at the moment to let Neo4j participate in managed JTA transactions spanning several resources (see issue https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/OGM-370[OGM-370]).

.Example of starting and committing transactions
====
[source, JAVA]
----
Session session = factory.openSession();
Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction();

Account account = new Account();
account.setLogin( "myAccount" );
session.persist( account );

tx.commit();

...

tx = session.beginTransaction();
Account savedAccount =  (Account) session.get( Account.class, account.getId() );
tx.commit();
----
====

[[ogm-neo4j-queries]]
=== Queries

You can express queries in a few different ways:

* using JP-QL
* using the Cypher query language

[NOTE]
====
Neo4J makes use of a Lucene version which
is not compatible with the most recent Hibernate Search version.
This unfortunately makes it impossible to use the latest Hibernate Search version
and Neo4J embedded in the same application.
====

While you can use JP-QL for simple queries, you might hit limitations.
The current recommended approach is to use native Cypher queries
if your query involves nested (list of) elements.

==== JP-QL queries

Hibernate OGM is a work in progress, so only a sub-set of JP-QL constructs is available
when using the JP-QL query support. This includes:

* simple comparisons using "<", "<=", "=", ">=" and ">"
* +IS NULL+ and +IS NOT NULL+
* the boolean operators +AND+, +OR+, +NOT+
* +LIKE+, +IN+ and +BETWEEN+
* +ORDER BY+

Queries using these constructs will be transformed into equivalent http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/cypher-query-lang.html[Cypher queries].

[NOTE]
====
Let us know <<ogm-howtocontribute,by opening an issue or sending an email>>
what query you wish to execute.
Expanding our support in this area is high on our priority list.
====

[[ogm-neo4j-queries-native]]
==== Cypher queries

Hibernate OGM also supports http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/cypher-query-lang.html[Cypher queries] for Neo4j.
You can execute Cypher queries as shown in the following example:

.Using the JPA API
====
[source, JAVA]
----
@Entity
public class Poem {

    @Id
    private Long id;

    private String name;

    private String author;

   // getters, setters ...

}

...

javax.persistence.EntityManager em = ...

// a single result query
String query1 = "MATCH ( n:Poem { name:'Portia', author:'Oscar Wilde' } ) RETURN n";
Poem poem = (Poem) em.createNativeQuery( query1, Poem.class ).getSingleResult();

// query with order by
String query2 = "MATCH ( n:Poem { name:'Portia', author:'Oscar Wilde' } ) " +
                "RETURN n ORDER BY n.name";
List<Poem> poems = em.createNativeQuery( query2, Poem.class ).getResultList();

// query with projections
String query3 = MATCH ( n:Poem ) RETURN n.name, n.author ORDER BY n.name";
List<Object[]> poemNames = (List<Object[]>)em.createNativeQuery( query3 )
                               .getResultList();

----
====

The result of a query is a managed entity (or a list thereof) or a projection of attributes in form of an object array,
just like you would get from a JP-QL query.

.Using the Hibernate native API
====
[source, JAVA]
----
OgmSession session = ...

String query1 = "MATCH ( n:Poem { name:'Portia', author:'Oscar Wilde' } ) " + 
                "RETURN n";
Poem poem = session.createNativeQuery( query1 )
                      .addEntity( "Poem", Poem.class )
                      .uniqueResult();

String query2 = "MATCH ( n:Poem { name:'Portia', author:'Oscar Wilde' } ) " + 
                "RETURN n ORDER BY n.name";
List<Poem> poems = session.createNativeQuery( query2 )
                      .addEntity( "Poem", Poem.class )
                      .list();
----
====

Native queries can also be created using the +@NamedNativeQuery+ annotation:

.Using @NamedNativeQuery
====
[source, JAVA]
----
@Entity
@NamedNativeQuery(
   name = "AthanasiaPoem",
   query = "MATCH ( n:Poem { name:'Athanasia', author:'Oscar Wilde' } ) RETURN n",
   resultClass = Poem.class )
public class Poem { ... }

...

// Using the EntityManager
Poem poem1 = (Poem) em.createNamedQuery( "AthanasiaPoem" )
                     .getSingleResult();

// Using the Session
Poem poem2 = (Poem) session.getNamedQuery( "AthanasiaPoem" )
                     .uniqueResult();
----
====

Hibernate OGM stores data in a natural way so you can still execute queries using your favorite tool,
the main drawback is that the results are going to be raw Neo4j elements and not managed entities.
