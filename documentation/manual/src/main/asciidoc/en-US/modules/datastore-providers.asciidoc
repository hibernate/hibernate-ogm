== Datastores

Currently Hibernate OGM supports the following datastores:

* Map: stores data in an in-memory Java map to store data.
  Use it only for unit tests.
* Infinispan: stores data into http://infinispan.org/[Infinispan] (data grid)
* Ehcache: stores data into http://ehcache.org/[Ehcache] (cache)
* MongoDB: stores data into http://www.mongodb.org/[MongoDB] (document store)
* Neo4j: stores data into http://www.neo4j.org/[Neo4j] (graph database)
* CouchDB: stores data into https://couchdb.apache.org/[CouchDB] (document store)

More are planned, if you are interested,
come talk to us (see <<ogm-howtocontribute>>).

Hibernate OGM interacts with NoSQL datastores via two contracts:

* a datastore provider which is responsible for
  starting and stopping the connection(s) with the datastore
  and prop up the datastore if needed
* a grid dialect which is responsible for
  converting an Hibernate OGM operation into a datastore specific operation


The main thing you need to do is to configure which datastore provider you want to use.
This is done via the +hibernate.ogm.datastore.provider+ option.
Possible values are

* the fully qualified class name of a [classname]+DatastoreProvider+ implementation or
* one preferably of the following shortcuts: +map+ (only to be used for unit tests),
+infinispan+, +ehcache+, +mongodb+, +neo4j+ or +couchdb+

[NOTE]
====
When bootstrapping a session factory or entity manager factory programmatically,
you should use the constants declared on +OgmProperties+ to specify configuration properties
such as +hibernate.ogm.datastore.provider+.
In this case you also can specify the provider in form of a class object of a datastore provider type
or pass an instance of a datastore provider type.
====

You also need to add the relevant Hibernate OGM module in your classpath.
In maven that would look like:

[source, XML]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.ogm</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-ogm-infinispan</artifactId>
    <version>{hibernate-ogm-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

The module names are
+hibernate-ogm-infinispan+, +hibernate-ogm-ehcache+, +hibernate-ogm-mongodb+, +hibernate-ogm-neo4j+ and +hibernate-ogm-couchdb+.
The map datastore is included in the Hibernate OGM engine module.

By default, a datastore provider chooses the best grid dialect transparently
but you can manually override that setting
with the +hibernate.ogm.datastore.grid_dialect+ option.
Use the fully qualified class name of the [classname]+GridDialect+ implementation.
Most users should ignore this setting entirely and live happy.
