# Read me on the documentation process

This file is not fleshed out, it's just a collection of tips.

## Diagrams

Diagrams are done in OmniGraffle and stored as XML files in `src/main/omnigraffle`.
Export the omnigraffle files as `png` with a dot per inch of 72. This will create
a file of the right size for the web.

`png` files, should be placed under `src/main/docbook/en-US/images`
