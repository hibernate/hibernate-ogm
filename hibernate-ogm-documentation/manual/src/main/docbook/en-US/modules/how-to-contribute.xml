  <title>How to get help and contribute on Hibernate OGM</title>

  <para>Hibernate OGM is a young project. The code, the direction and the
  documentation are all in flux and being built by the community. Come and
  help us shape it!</para>

    <title>How to get help</title>

    <para>First of all, make sure to read this reference documentation. This
    is the most comprehensive formal source of information. Of course, it is

    <para>Hibernate OGM's code is available on GitHub at <ulink

    <section>
      <title>how to build Hibernate OGM</title>

      <para>Hibernate OGM uses Git and Maven 3, make sure to have both
      installed on your system.</para>

      <para>Clone the git repository from GitHub:</para>

      <programlisting>#get the sources
git clone https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-ogm
cd hibernate-ogm</programlisting>

      <para>Run maven</para>

      <programlisting>#build project
mvn clean install -s settings-example.xml</programlisting>

      <note>
        <para>Note that Hibernate OGM uses artifacts from the Maven repository
        hosted by JBoss. Make sure to either use the <code>-s
        settings-example.xml</code> option or adjust your
        <filename>~/.m2/settings.xml</filename> according to the descriptions
        available <ulink
        url="http://community.jboss.org/wiki/MavenGettingStarted-Users">on
        this page</ulink>.</para>
      </note>

      <para>To build the documentation, set the buildDocs property to
      true.</para>

      <programlisting>mvn clean install -DbuildDocs=true -s settings-example.xml</programlisting>

      <remark>If you just want to build the documentation, run it from the
      <filename>hibernate-ogm-documentation/manual</filename>
      subdirectory.</remark>

    <section>
      <title>How to contribute code effectively</title>

      <para>The best way to share code is to fork Hibernate OGM repository on
      GitHub, create a branch and open a pull request when you are ready. Make
      sure to rebase your pull request on the latest version of the master
      branch before offering it.</para>

      <para>Here are a couple of approaches the team follows:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>We do small independent commits for each code change. In
          particular, we do not mix stylistic code changes (import, typo etc)
          and new feature in the same commit.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Commit messages follow the following convention: a short
          commit summary preceded by the JIRA issue number, an empty line, a
          longer description if needed.</para>

          <programlisting>OGM-123 Summary of commit operation

Optional details on the commit.</programlisting>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>A pull request contains the feature, its unit tests, its
          documentation</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>All commits are proposed via pull requests and reviewed by
          another member of the team before being pushed to the reference
          repository.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
