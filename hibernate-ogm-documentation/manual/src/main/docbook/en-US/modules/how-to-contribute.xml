  <title>How to get help and contribute on Hibernate OGM</title>

  <para>Hibernate OGM is a young project. The code, the direction and the
  documentation are all in flux and being built by the community. Join
  and help us shape it!</para>

    <title>How to get help</title>

    <para>First of all, make sure to read this reference documentation. This
    is the most comprehensive formal source of information. Of course, it is
    not perfect: feel free to come and ask for help, comment or propose
    improvements in our <ulink

    <para>Hibernate OGM's code is available on GitHub at <ulink

      <title>How to build Hibernate OGM</title>

      <para>Hibernate OGM uses Git and Maven 3, make sure to have both
      installed on your system.</para>

      <para>Clone the git repository from GitHub:</para>

      <programlisting>#get the sources
git clone https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-ogm
cd hibernate-ogm</programlisting>

      <para>Run maven</para>

      <programlisting>#build project
mvn clean install -s settings-example.xml</programlisting>

      <note>
        <para>Note that Hibernate OGM uses artifacts from the Maven repository
        hosted by JBoss. Make sure to either use the <code>-s
        settings-example.xml</code> option or adjust your
        <filename>~/.m2/settings.xml</filename> according to the descriptions
        available <ulink
        url="http://community.jboss.org/wiki/MavenGettingStarted-Users">on
        this jboss.org wiki page</ulink>.</para>
      </note>

      <para>To build the documentation, set the <literal>buildDocs</literal> property to
      true:</para>

      <programlisting>mvn clean install -DbuildDocs=true -s settings-example.xml</programlisting>

      <remark>If you just want to build the documentation only, run it from the
      <filename>hibernate-ogm-documentation/manual</filename>
      subdirectory.</remark>

    <section>
      <title>How to contribute code effectively</title>

      <para>The best way to share code is to fork the Hibernate OGM repository
      on GitHub, create a branch and open a pull request when you are ready. Make
      sure to rebase your pull request on the latest version of the master
      branch before offering it.</para>

      <para>Here are a couple of approaches the team follows:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>We do small independent commits for each code change. In
          particular, we do not mix stylistic code changes (import, typos, etc)
          and new features in the same commit.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Commit messages follow this convention: the JIRA issue number,
          a short commit summary, an empty line, a longer description if needed.
          Make sure to limit line length to 80 characters, even at this day and
          age it makes for more readable commit comments.</para>

          <programlisting>OGM-123 Summary of commit operation

Optional details on the commit
and a longer description can be
added here.</programlisting>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>A pull request can contain several commits but should be
          self contained: include the implementation, its unit tests, its
          documentation and javadoc changes if needed.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>All commits are proposed via pull requests and reviewed by
          another member of the team before being pushed to the reference
          repository. That's right, we never commit directly upstream without
          code review.</para>
        </listitem>
