  <title>Query your entities</title>

  <para>Hibernate Search works perfectly well with Hibernate OGM. You can wrap
  an Hibernate OGM <classname>Session</classname> or
  <classname>EntityManager</classname> with a
  <classname>FullTextSession</classname> or
  <classname>FullTextEntityManager</classname> like you would do with
  Hibernate ORM (via the static methods hosted on
  <classname>Search</classname>).</para>

  <para>The same configurations options available in Hibernate Search when
  using Hibernate ORM are also relevant.</para>

  <para>Of course, make sure to add the necessary Hibernate Search mapping
  annotations on your domain model to properly index your entities.</para>

  <para>TODO: talk about Hibernate Search queries.</para>

  <para>Talk about the JP-QL parser when we have that integrated.</para>
</chapter>
