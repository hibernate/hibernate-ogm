  <title>Query your entities</title>

  <para>To query a NoSQL database is a complex feat, especially as not all NoSQL
  solutions support any form of query. One of the goals of Hibernate OGM is to
  deal with this complexity so that users don't have to, However, that's not yet
  all implemented and depending on your use case there might be better
  approaches you can take advantage of.</para>

  <para>If you skipped to this section without reading <xref
  linkend="ogm-architecture"/>, I'd suggest to read at least <xref
  linkend="ogm-architecture-dataqueried"/> as it will greatly help you
  choosing a query approach.</para>

  <section>
  <title>Using JP-QL</title>
    <para>
        For Hibernate OGM we developed a brand new JP-QL parser which is already
        able to convert simple queries using Hibernate Search under
        the precondition that:
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>no join, aggregation, or other relational
                    operations are implied</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>you are using the Hibernate Session API (JPA
                    integration is coming)</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>the target entities and properties are indexed by
                    Hibernate Search (no validation is happening today)
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
    </para>

  <para>We do realize these are strong limitations, so while it might be interesting
  to try it out, for real usage we suggest for now to use either Hibernate Search
  FullTextQueries or the native query technology of the NoSQL storage you are using.
  </para>
  
  <para>To provide an example of what kind of queries would work:</para>
  <example>
        <title>Example of trivial Hibernate Query remapped on Hibernate Search</title>
        <programlisting language="JAVA" role="JAVA">Query query = session
    .createQuery("from Hypothesis h where h.description = :desc")
    .setString("desc", "tomorrow it's going to rain");
</programlisting>
<programlisting language="JAVA" role="JAVA">@Entity @Indexed
public class Hypothesis {

    @Id
    public String getId() { return id; }
    public void setId(String id) { this.id = id; }
    private String id;

    @Field(analyze=Analyze.NO)
    public String getDescription() { return description; }
    public void setDescription(String description) { this.description = description; }
    private String description;
}</programlisting></example>
  </section>

  <section>
     <title>Using Hibernate Search</title>

     <para>We actually did use Hibernate Search already in the previous example; specifically
     the annotations <classname>@Indexed</classname> and <classname>@Field</classname>
     are Hibernate Search specific. In this example the query was defined using a
     <literal>JP-QL</literal> string and then defining parameters; that's useful
     if all you have a is a <literal>JP-QL</literal> Query, but it is limiting.</para>

     <para>Hibernate Search remaps the properties annotated with <classname>@Field</classname>
     in Lucene Documents, and manages the Lucene indexes so that you can then perform
     Lucene Queries.</para>

    <para>To be extremely short, Apache Lucene is a fulltext indexing and query engine
    with excellent query performance. Featurewise, <emphasis>full-text</emphasis> means
    you can do much more than a simple equality match as we did in the previous example.</para>

    <para>Let's show another example, now creating a Lucene Query instead:</para>
    <example>
        <title>Using Hibernate Search for fulltext matching</title>
        <programlisting language="JAVA" role="JAVA">EntityManager entityManager = ...
//Add full-text superpowers to any EntityManager:
FullTextEntityManager ftem = Search.getFullTextEntityManager(entityManager);

//Optionally use the QueryBuilder to simplify Query definition:
QueryBuilder b = ftem.getSearchFactory()
   .buildQueryBuilder()
   .forEntity(Hypothesis.class)
   .get();

//Create a Lucene Query:
Query lq = b.keyword().onField("description").matching("tomorrow").createQuery();

//Transform the Lucene Query in a JPA Query:
FullTextQuery ftQuery = ftem.createFullTextQuery(lq, Hypothesis.class);
//This is a requirement when using Hibernate OGM instead of ORM:
ftQuery.initializeObjectsWith(ObjectLookupMethod.SKIP,
      DatabaseRetrievalMethod.FIND_BY_ID);

//List all matching Hypothesis:
List&lt;Hypothesis&gt; resultList = ftQuery.getResultList();
</programlisting>
</example>

<para>Assuming our database contains an <classname>Hypothesis</classname>
instance having description "tomorrow we release", the query above will not
find the entity because we disabled text analysis in the previous mapping.</para>

<para>If we enable text analysis (which is the default):</para>
<example><title>Entity enabling text analysis</title>
<programlisting language="JAVA" role="JAVA">@Entity @Indexed
public class Hypothesis {

    @Id
    public String getId() { return id; }
    public void setId(String id) { this.id = id; }
    private String id;

    @Field(analyze=Analyze.YES)
    public String getDescription() { return description; }
    public void setDescription(String description) { this.description = description; }
    private String description;
}</programlisting></example>

     <para>Now the entity would match a query on "tomorrow" as we're unlocking
     text similarity queries!</para>

    <para>Text similarity can be very powerful as it can be configured for specific
    languages or domain specific terminology; it can deal with typos and synonyms,
    and above all it can return results by <emphasis>relevance</emphasis>.</para>

    <para>Worth noting the the Lucene index is a vectorial space of term occurrence
    statistics: so extracting tags from text, frequencies of strings and correlate
    this data makes it very easy to build efficient data analisys applications.</para>

    <para>For a full explanation of all its capabilities and configuration options
    see the <ulink
    url="http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/search/reference/en-US/html_single/">
    Hibernate Search reference documentation</ulink>.</para>

    <para>
    While the potential of Lucene queries is very high, it's not suited for all
    use cases.
    Let's see some of the limitations of Lucene Queries as our
    main query engine:
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>Lucene doesn't support Joins. Any <literal>to-One</literal> relations
                can be mapped fine, and the Lucene community is making progress
                on other forms, but restrictions on <literal>OneToMany</literal> or
                <literal>ManyToMany</literal> can't be implemented today.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Since we apply changes to the index at commit time,
                your updates won't affect queries until you commit. (we
                might improve on this)</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>While queries are extremely fast, write operations are
                not as fast. (but we can make it scale)</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
