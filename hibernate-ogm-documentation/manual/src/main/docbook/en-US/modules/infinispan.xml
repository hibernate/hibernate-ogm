  <title>Infinispan</title>

  <para>Infinispan is an open source in-memory data grid focusing on high performance.
  As a data grid, you can deploy it on multiple servers - referred to as nodes - and
  connect to it as if it were a single storage engine: it will cleverly distribute both
  the computation effort and the data storage.</para>

  <para>It is trivial to setup on a single node, in your local JVM, so you can easily
    try Hibernate OGM. But Infinispan really shines in multiple node deployments:
    you will need to configure some networking details but nothing changes in terms
    of application behaviour, while performance and data size can scale linearly.</para>

  <para>From all its features we'll only describe those relevant to Hibernate OGM;
    for a complete description of all its capabilities and configuration options
    refer to the Infinispan project documentation at
    <ulink url="http://infinispan.org">www.infinispan.org</ulink>.

    <para>We'll explain in the following paragraphs how you can take advantage of this, and
    which aspects of Infinispan you're likely to want to reconfigure from their defaults.
    All attributes and elements from Infinispan which we don't mention are safe to ignore,
    or refer to the <ulink url="https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/ISPN/User+Guide">Infinispan
    User Guide</ulink> for the guru level performance tuning and customizations.</para>

    <para>An Infinispan configuration file is an XML file complying with the Infinispan schema;
    the basic structure is shown in the following example:</para>
    <example>
        <title>Simple structure of an infinispan xml configuration file</title>

        <programlisting language="XML" role="XML">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

    xmlns="urn:infinispan:config:5.1"&gt;

    &lt;global&gt;
    &lt;/global&gt;

    &lt;default&gt;
    &lt;/default&gt;

    &lt;namedCache name="ENTITIES"&gt;

    &lt;namedCache name="ASSOCIATIONS"&gt;

    &lt;namedCache name="IDENTIFIERS"&gt;
    &lt;/namedCache&gt;

&lt;/infinispan&gt;</programlisting>
      </example>

    <para>The <literal>global</literal> section contains elements which affect the whole instance;
    mainly of interest for Hibernate OGM users is the <literal>transport</literal> element, in which we'll
    set JGroups configuration overrides.</para>

    <para>In the <literal>namedCache</literal> section (or in <literal>default</literal> if
    we want to affect all named caches) we'll likely want to configure clustering modes, eviction
    policies and <literal>CacheStore</literal>s.</para>

  </section>

  </section>

  <section id="ogm-infinispan-storage">
    <title>Manage data size</title>

  <para>In its default configuration Infinispan stores all data in the heap of the JVM;
    in this barebone mode it is conceptually not very different than using a HashMap:
    the size of the data should fit in the heap of your VM, and stopping/killing/crashing
    your application will get all data lost, with no way to recover it.</para>

  <para>To store data permanently (out of the JVM memory) a <literal>CacheStore</literal>
    should be enabled. The <literal>infinispan-core.jar</literal> includes a simple
    implementation able to store data in simple binary files, on any read/write mounted
    filesystem; this is an easy starting point, but the real stuff is to be found in
    the additional modules found in the Infinispan distribution. Here you can find
    many more implementations to store your data in anything from JDBC connected
    relational databases, other NoSQL engines, to cloud storage services or other
    Infinispan clusters. Finally, implementing a custom <literal>CacheStore</literal>
    is a trivial programming exercise.</para>

  <para>To limit the memory consumption of the precious heap space you can activate
    a <literal>passivation</literal> or an <literal>eviction</literal> policy;
    again there are several strategies to play with, for now let's just consider
    you'll likely need one to avoid running out of memory when storing too many entries
    in the bounded JVM memory space; of course you don't need to choose one while
    experimenting with limited data sizes: enabling such a strategy
    doesn't have any other impact in the functionality of your Hibernate OGM application
    (other than performance: entries stored in the Infinispan in-memory space
    is accessed much quicker than from any CacheStore).</para>

  <para>A <literal>CacheStore</literal> can be configured as write-through, committing
    all changes to the <literal>CacheStore</literal>
    before returning (and in the same transaction) or as write-behind. A write-behind
    configuration is normally not encouraged in storage engines, as a failure of the
    node implies some data might be lost without receiving any notification about it,
    but this problem is mitigated in Infinispan because of its capability to combine
    CacheStore write-behind with a synchronous replication to other Infinispan nodes.
  </para>

<example>
        <title>Enabling a FileCacheStore and eviction</title>

        <programlisting language="XML" role="XML">&lt;namedCache name="ENTITIES"&gt;
  &lt;eviction strategy="LIRS" maxEntries="2000" /&gt;
  &lt;loaders
    passivation="true" shared="false"&gt;
    &lt;loader
      class="org.infinispan.loaders.file.FileCacheStore"
      fetchPersistentState="false"
      purgeOnStartup="false"&gt;
      &lt;properties&gt;
        &lt;property name="location" value="/var/hibernate-ogm/myapp/entities-data" /&gt;
      &lt;/properties&gt;
    &lt;/loader&gt;
  &lt;/loaders&gt;
&lt;/namedCache&gt;</programlisting>
      </example>

    <para>In this example we enabled both <literal>eviction</literal> and a
    <literal>CacheStore</literal> (the <literal>loader</literal> element).
    <literal>LIRS</literal> is one of the choices we have for eviction strategies,
    and is configured to keep (approximately) 2000 entries in live memory, and evict
    the remaining as a memory usage control strategy.</para>
    <para>The <literal>CacheStore</literal> is enabling <literal>passivation</literal>,
    which means that the entries which are evicted are stored on the filesystem.</para>

    <warning><para>You could configure an eviction strategy while not configuring a
    passivating CacheStore! That is a valid configuration for Infinispan but will have
    the evictor permanently remove entries. Hibernate OGM will break in such a configuration.
    </para></warning>

    <tip>
    <para>Currently with Infinispan 5.1 the <classname>FileCacheStore</classname> is
    neither very fast nor very efficient: we picked it for ease of setup; for
    a production system it's worth looking at the large collection of high performance
    and cloud friendly cachestores provided by the Infinispan distribution.</para>
    </tip>

  </section>

  <section id="ogm-infinispan-clustering">
    <title>Clustering: deploy multiple Infinispan nodes</title>

    <para>The best thing about Infinispan is that all nodes are treated equally,
    and it requires almost no beforehand capacity planning: to add more nodes to
    the cluster you just have to start new JVMs, on the same or different physical
    server, having your same Infinispan configuration and your same application.</para>

    <para>Infinispan supports several clustering <emphasis>cache modes</emphasis>; each
    mode provides the same API and functionality but with different performance, scalability
    and availability options:</para>

    <table>
    <title>Infinispan cache modes</title>

                <entry>All data is replicated to each node; each node
                contains a full copy of all entries. Consequentially reads are faster
                but writes don't scale as well. Not suited for very large datasets.</entry>
            </row>
            <row>
                <entry><constant>distribution</constant></entry>
                <entry>Each entry is distributed on multiple nodes for
                redundancy and failure recovery, but not to all the nodes.
                Provides linear scalability for both write and read operations.
                <constant>distribution</constant> is the default mode!</entry>
            </row>
        </tbody>
    </tgroup>
</table>

    <para>To use the <literal>replication</literal> or <literal>distribution</literal>
    cache modes Infinispan will use JGroups to discover and connect to the other
    nodes.</para>

    <para>In the default configuration JGroups will attempt to autodetect peer
    nodes using a multicast socket; this works out of the box in the most
    network environments but will require some extra configuration in cloud
    environments (which often block multicast packets) or in case of strict firewalls.
    See the <ulink url="http://www.jgroups.org/manual/html_single/">JGroups
    reference documentation</ulink>, specifically look for
    <emphasis>Discovery Protocols</emphasis> to customize the detection of peer
    nodes.</para>

    <para>Nowadays the <acronym>JVM</acronym> nowadays defaults to use <acronym>IPv6</acronym>
    network stack; this will work fine with JGroups, but only if you configured
    <acronym>IPv6</acronym> correctly. It is often useful to force the <acronym>JVM</acronym>
    to use <acronym>IPv4</acronym>!</para>

    <para>It is also useful to let JGroups know which networking interface you want it to use;
    especially if you have multiple interfaces it might not guess correctly.</para>

    <example>
       <title>JVM properties to set for clustering</title>
        <programlisting><lineannotation>#192.168.122.1 is an example IPv4 address</lineannotation>
-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -Djgroups.bind_addr=192.168.122.1</programlisting>
    </example>

    <note><para>You don't need to use <acronym>IPv4</acronym>: JGroups is compatible with
    <acronym>IPv6</acronym> provided you have routing properly configured and valid
    addresses assigned.</para>
    <para>The <literal>jgroups.bind_addr</literal> needs to match
    a placeholder name in your JGroups configuration in case you don't use the
    default one.</para></note>

    <para>The default configuration uses <literal>distribution</literal> as cache mode and
    uses the <literal>jgroups-tcp.xml</literal> configuration for JGroups, which is contained
    in the Infinispan jar as the default configuration for Infinispan users.
    Let's see how to reconfigure this:</para>

  <example>
    <title>Reconfiguring cache mode and override JGroups configuration</title>
    <programlisting language="XML" role="XML">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;infinispan
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="urn:infinispan:config:5.1 http://www.infinispan.org/schemas/infinispan-config-5.1.xsd"
    xmlns="urn:infinispan:config:5.1"&gt;

    &lt;global&gt;
        &lt;transport
            clusterName="HibernateOGM-Infinispan-cluster"&gt;
            &lt;properties&gt;
                &lt;property name="configurationFile" value="my-jgroups-conf.xml" /&gt;
            &lt;/properties&gt;
        &lt;/transport&gt;
    &lt;/global&gt;

    &lt;default&gt;
        &lt;clustering
            mode="distribution" /&gt;
    &lt;/default&gt;

    &lt;!-- Cache to store the OGM entities --&gt;
    &lt;namedCache
        name="ENTITIES"&gt;
    &lt;/namedCache&gt;

    &lt;!-- Cache to store the relations across entities --&gt;
    &lt;namedCache
        name="ASSOCIATIONS"&gt;
    &lt;/namedCache&gt;

    &lt;!-- Cache to store identifiers --&gt;
    &lt;namedCache
        name="IDENTIFIERS"&gt;
        &lt;!-- Override the cache mode: --&gt;
        &lt;clustering
            mode="replication" /&gt;
    &lt;/namedCache&gt;

&lt;/infinispan&gt;</programlisting>
      </example>

  <para>In the example above we specify a custom JGroups configuration file and
  set the cache mode for the default cache to <literal>distribution</literal>;
  this is going to be inherited by the <literal>ENTITIES</literal> and the
  <literal>ASSOCIATIONS</literal> caches, but for <literal>IDENTIFIERS</literal>
  we have chosen (for the sake of this example) to use <literal>replication</literal>.</para>

  <para>Now that you have clustering configured, all what is needed is to start the service
  on multiple nodes. Each node will need the same configuration and jars.</para>

  <tip>
  <para>We have just shown how to override the clustering mode and the networking stack
  for the sake of completeness, but you don't have to!</para>
  <para>Start with the default configuration and see if that fits you.
  You can fine tune these setting when you are closer to going in production.</para>

    <title>Transactions</title>
    <para>Infinispan supports transactions and integrates with any standard JTA

    <para>A common place to store these indexes is the filesystem which is the default
    for Hibernate Search; however if your goal is to scale your NoSQL engine
    on multiple nodes you need to share this index. Network sharing filesystems are
    a possibility but we don't recommended that at all. Often the best option is to store the index
    in wathever NoSQL database you are using (or a different dedicated one).</para>

    <tip><para>You might find this section useful even if you don't intend to store your data
    in Infinispan.</para></tip>

    <para>The Infinispan project provides an adaptor to plug into Apache Lucene, so that it writes
    the indexes in Infinispan and searches data in it. Since Infinispan
    can be used as an application cache to other NoSQL storage engines by using a CacheStore
    (see <xref linkend="ogm-infinispan-storage" />) you can use this adaptor to store the
    Lucene indexes in any NoSQL store supported by Infinispan:

    This configuration is not going to scale well on write operations:
    to do that you should read about the master/slave and sharding
    options in Hibernate Search. The complete explanation and
    configuration options can be found in the
    <ulink
        url="http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/4.2/reference/en-US/html_single/#infinispan-directories">

    <para>Some NoSQL support storage of Lucene indexes directly, in which
    case you might skip the Infinispan Lucene integration by implementing
    a custom <classname>DirectoryProvider</classname> for Hibernate Search.
    You're very welcome to share the code and have it merged in Hibernate
    Search for others to use, inspect, improve and maintain.</para>
