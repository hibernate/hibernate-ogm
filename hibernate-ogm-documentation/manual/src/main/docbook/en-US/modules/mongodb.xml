                            This could lead to loss of writes. When set to <literal>true</literal> which means
                            the driver will wait for the operation to succeed before returning.
                            Note that this is slower than the unsafe mode.

                            <literal>COLLECTION</literal> stores the association in a dedicated MongoDB collection
                            per association
                            <literal>IN_ENTITY</literal> stores association information from within the entity.

        <note>
            <para>The general policy in Hibernate OGM is to not go against the
                underlying NoSQL store. We have made an exception for MongoDB's write
                concern default setting - which is unsafe out of the box. Based on the
                typical use case of Hibernate OGM (domain models) and based on the
                production feedback we have received, we do consider MongoDB's default
                value to be dangerous.</para>

            <title>Entities</title>
            <para>
                Entities are stored as MongoDB documents and not as BLOBs which means each entity property will be
                translated into a document field. You can use the name property of @Table and @Column annotation and so
                rename the collections and the document's field.
                Document oriented NoSQL solution are powerful
            </para>
            <section>
                <title>Identifiers</title>
                <para>
                    The <literal>_id</literal> field of a MongoDB document is directly used to store the ID mapped
                    in the entities. That means you can use simple IDs (no matter the Java type used) as well as
                    Embedded ids. Embedded ids are stored as embedded document into the <literal>_id</literal> field.
                    The dialect is in charge to map the <literal>@Id</literal> entity property with the
                    <literal>_id</literal> document field so you can name the entity id like you want it will always be
                    stored into <literal>_id</literal> and so you can benefit from the MongoDB index on _id fields.
                    For instance if you have an entity like:

            <title>Associations</title>
            <para>
                Hibernate OGM MongoDB proposes 3 strategies to store navigation information for associations. To switch
                between each of these strategies, you have to use the <literal>hibernate.ogm.mongodb.associations.store</literal>
                configuration property.
                The three possible values are:
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>GLOBAL_COLLECTION</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>COLLECTION</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>IN_ENTITY</para>
                    </listitem>
                </itemizedlist>
                If this property is not explicitly set, the IN_ENTITY strategy is chose by default.
        </para>

            <section>
                <title>Global collection strategy</title>
                <para>
                    This strategy means that OGM will create a single collection in which it will stores all navigation
                    information for all associations. Each document of this collection is structure in 2 parts.
                    The first is the <literal>_id</literal> field which contains ID of the association owner and the name
                    of the entities that are at each side of the relationship.
                    The second part is the <literal>rows</literal> field which stores (into an embedded collection) all
                    ids that the current instance is related to.
                </para>
                <example>
                    <title>Unidirectional relationship</title>
                    <programlisting role="JSON" language="JSON">
{
    "_id": {
        "owners_id": "owner0001",
        "table": "AccountOwner_BankAccount"
    },
    "rows": [
        { "bankAccounts_id": "accountXYZ" }
    ]
}
                    </programlisting>
                </example>

                <para>
                    In case of bidirectional relationships, another document is created and the IDs are switched which
                    look like this:
                </para>

                <example>
                    <title>Bidirectional relationship</title>
                    <programlisting role="JSON" language="JSON">
{
    "_id": {
        "owners_id": "owner0001",
        "table": "AccountOwner_BankAccount"
    },
    "rows": [{
        "bankAccounts_id": "accountXYZ"
        }]
}
{
    "_id": {
        "bankAccounts_id": "accountXYZ",
        "table": "AccountOwner_BankAccount"
    },
    "rows": [{
        "owners_id": "owner0001"
    }]
}
                    </programlisting>
                </example>

            </section>
            <section>
                <title>One collection per association strategy</title>
                <para>
                    This strategy means that OGM will create a collection in which it will stores all navigation
                    information per association. So if an entity A is related to B and C thus 2 collections will be
                    created. The name of this collection is made by concatening `associations_" with the name of both
                    entities that participate to the relationship. For example, if the BankAccount and Owner are related,
                    the collection used to store will be named <literal>associations_Owner_BankAccount</literal>.
                    Internally, each document of this collection has the following structure:
                    <itemizedlist>
                        <listitem>
                            <para><literal>_id</literal> contains the id of the owner of relationship</para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para><literal>rows</literal> contains all the id of the related entities</para>
                        </listitem>
                    </itemizedlist>
                </para>

                <example>
                    <title>Unidirectional relationship</title>
                    <programlisting role="JSON" language="JSON">
{
    "_id" : { "owners_id" : "owner0001" },
    "rows" : [
        { "bankAccounts_id" : "accountXYZ" }
    ]
}
                    </programlisting>
                </example>

}
{
    "_id" : { "bankAccounts_id" : "accountXYZ" },
    "rows" : [
        { "owners_id" : "owner0001" }
    ]
}

            <section>
                <title>In Entity strategy</title>
                <para>
                    This strategy works pretty like the a foreign key in order terms, OGM will directly store the
                    id of the other side of the association into a field or an embedded document depending if the mapping
                    concerns a single object or a collection. The field that stores the relationship information is
                    named like the entity property.
                </para>
