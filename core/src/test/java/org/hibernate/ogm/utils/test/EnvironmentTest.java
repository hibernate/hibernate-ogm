 * To be run in an IDE this test requires option -Dhibernate.service.allow_crawling=false
 * In fact the whole purpose is to verify the testsuite is run with this option enabled.
 *
 * We run the testsuite with ALLOW_CRAWLING disabled to make sure the project is using the
 * latest version (definition) of any Service defined by Hibernate ORM: since HHH-8619
 * ORM will attempt to translate legacy service requests remapping them to their new
 * version. By disabling this in our testsuite we make sure that at least at release time
 * of a version of OGM the services are up to date.
